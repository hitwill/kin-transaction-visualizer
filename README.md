## A visualizer for the Kin blockchain

The visualizer runs completely on the client-side, needing only to source some js files

This is a community built visualizer for Kin's blockchain. Official stats, like DAS can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kinfoundation#!/vizhome/Kinecosystemstats/Kinecosystemstats).

A running version of this code can be found on: [kin-bubbles.herokuapp.com](https://kin-bubbles.herokuapp.com)

## Legend
**Mountain height:** dominance in total transactions (create account/ earn /spend).

**Horizontal bars:** on the top left are the number of new accounts and spends per second.

**Bubble size:** is the size of the earn/ spend - with >=100 Kin getting a special animation

**Anon bubble:** Some transactions do not have an app memo, and may be from exchanges.
